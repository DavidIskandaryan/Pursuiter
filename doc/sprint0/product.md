#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a job application platform called Pursuiter that provides tailored job recommendations to applicants and efficient applicant filtering for employers.

* **High-level description:** Pursuiter is a job application platform that tailors job recommendations for applicants and filters applicants for employers.
* **Problem:** Job seekers often get rejected due to not meeting job requirements, and employers receive many unqualified applications.
* **Solution:** Pursuiter aims to reduce rejections for applicants by providing tailored job recommendations and help employers filter out unqualified applicants effectively.
* **Product Type:** Website
* **Common Use Cases:**
  - **Applicants:** Receive job recommendations based on their profiles and qualifications, apply for jobs they are eligible for, and get feedback on their applications.
  - **Employers:** Post job listings, receive qualified applications, and filter applicants using AI-generated summaries and statistics.

### Highlights

1. **Decision on Tailored Recommendations:** We considered generic job recommendations versus tailored recommendations. We chose tailored recommendations to increase the chances of applicants getting hired and to reduce rejection rates.
2. **Application Filtering:** We debated between manual filtering by employers and automated filtering using AI. Automated filtering was chosen to save employers time and improve efficiency.
3. **Employer Stats and Summaries:** We discussed providing basic application lists versus detailed AI-generated summaries. Detailed summaries were chosen to give employers better insights and make more informed decisions.
4. **Team Organization:** All members are full-stack developers to gain experience in all fields.
5. **Meeting Schedule:**
   - **Standups:** Everyday, in-person.
   - **Tuesday Meeting:** 3:00 - 4:00 pm, online asynchronous.
   - **Sprint Planning:** Thursday (before new sprint), 3:00 - 4:00 pm, online synchronous.
   - **Sprint Retro:** Thursday (after sprint ends), 3:00 - 4:00 pm, online synchronous.
   - All members get a ‘free pass’ to miss one meeting.
